### About These Notebooks

These notebooks are my solutions to the exercises from [Mr. Daniel Bourke's PyTorch Course](https://www.learnpytorch.io/). The course is an excellent resource for learning PyTorch and deep learning, and I highly recommend checking it out.

Please note that these solutions are my implementations and may differ from those provided in the course. Feel free to explore and modify them as you learn!


### Note on Viewing Jupyter Notebooks on GitHub**
If you encounter an error like "There was an error rendering your Notebook: the 'state' key is missing from 'metadata.widgets'" while trying to view this Jupyter Notebook on GitHub, please note that this is due to GitHub's rendering limitations for notebooks containing certain metadata (e.g., interactive widgets).

To resolve this, you can:

1. **Download the notebook to your local machine and open it with Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.**
2. **Open the notebook in Google Colab by uploading the file or using the GitHub link directly in Colab.**
   
This does not affect the functionality of the notebook when run locally or in Colab. Thank you for understanding!
